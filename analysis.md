## Layer 11, Head 11

### Input: When outdoors I often see [MASK].
#### - It was interesting to see the relationship and build of density in the direct objects portions of my sentence. It appears to give significant attention to "outdoors I often" and then "see" and "MASK" on the "x" and "y" axis. It did a pretty good job of outputting actual things that could be seen outdoors, both day and night.

### Output:
#### 1. When outdoors I often see birds.
#### 2. When outdoors I often see butterflies.
#### 3. When outdoors I often see stars.

## Layer 1, Head 11

### Input: When watching movies I prefer [MASK] films.
#### - In this phase of the modeling significant attention is given to “movies” and “prefer” where “watching” and “films” received elevated attention. It appears that the model is identifying actionable words and beginning to predict what may be acceptable as outputs. Again, the MLM did a good job of outputting types of movies a person could be interested in. 

### Output:
#### 1. When watching movies I prefer silent films.
#### 2. When watching movies I prefer horror films.
#### 3. When watching movies I prefer action films.
