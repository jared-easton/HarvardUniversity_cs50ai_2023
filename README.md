## CS50’s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence w/ Python

### This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. Through hands-on projects, I gained exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, machine learning, large language models, and other topics in artificial intelligence as I incorporated them into my own Python programs. By course’s end, I emerged with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles that enabled the ability to design intelligent systems of my own.
